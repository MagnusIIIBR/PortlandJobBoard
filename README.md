#Introduction

This is a web application to replace portlandtech.org, a non-profit site run by the state of Oregon.

Portlandtech.org is a great resource for job-seekers, but the job listings are hand-curated, obviously a very time-consuming process.

Our immediate goal is to make a proof-of-concept working prototype we can demonstrate to the executives running portlandtech.org. We've been given an opportunity, but since we're dealing with a government entity, it won't be easy to convince them to change their ways. 

This web app is made using MVC 5, C# and ASP.NET. HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JavaScript on the front-end.

We will scrape the job sites using Python, unless the site offers an API. You'll need to generate a JSON file from each scrape, which we will use to populate the database.

This is the beginning of the project, so as we start on the backlog and learn what works and doesn't work, a lot could change. Be open in your feedback and suggestions. 

#Getting Started

Now that you are linked to the TFS, you should have a full copy of the project "mapped and got" to your local computer.

If you are editing a file that others may be working on-- such as the Index file-- be sure to "check out" the file. This lets everyone know that you're working on it, and it won't allow anyone to "check in" the file until you have also "checked in" the file.

After successfully editing a file that you would like to send to TFS, simply "check in" that file, and the administrator will receive a notification and be able to view the changes.

#Choosing a Backlog Item

Under "Work" you'll find a list of stories that need to be completed. Inside each story you'll see a section called "Assigned to". If you'd like to choose the project, assign it to yourself.

If you need to communicate with the Project Manager or another team member, below each item is a "Discussion" section. Using Twitter-style "@____person's_name_____" you can tag and communicate.
